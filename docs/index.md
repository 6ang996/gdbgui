`gdbgui` is a browser-based frontend to the `gdb` debugger . You can add breakpoints, view stack traces, and more in C, C++, Go, and Rust! It's perfect for beginners and experts. Simply run `gdbgui` from the terminal to start the gdbgui server, and a new tab will open in your browser.

[gdb (gnu debugger)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) allows you to see what is going on 'inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. It is widely distributed and used, but is terminal-based and can increase your cognitive load while using it.

gdbgui is used all around the world, including by engineers at Google in college computer science course instructions.
