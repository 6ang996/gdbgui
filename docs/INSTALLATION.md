# gdbgui installation

## Try Without Installing
By using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx-app), you can run Python CLI programs in ephemeral one-time virtual environments.
```
pipx run gdbgui
```
A new tab running the latest version of gdbgui will open in your browser. Press CTRL+C to end the process, and your system will remain untouched.


## Recommended Installation Instructions
gdbgui recommends using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx-app), a program to run Python CLI binaries in isolated environments. You can install pipx like this:
```
python3 -m pip install --user pipx-bootstrap
pipx-bootstrap
```

Then install gdbgui with pipx:
```
pipx install gdbgui
```

To upgrade run
```
pipx upgrade gdbgui
```

When installation is finished, type `gdbgui` from the command line to run it, or `gdbgui -h` for help.

## Alternate Installation 1
If you prefer to use Virtual Environments, you can activate one and then run
```
pip install gdbgui
```

## Alternate Installation 2
Download and run the binary executable for your system on [gdbgui.com](http://gdbgui.com).

## System Dependencies
Note that this only applies if you are installing the Python package, and not using the binary executable from gdbgui.com.

* gdb (gnu debugger)
* Python 3.4+ (recommended) or 2.7
* pip version 8 or higher

### Linux Dependencies
    sudo apt-get install gdb python3

### macOS Dependencies
    brew install python3
    brew install gdb --with-python --with-all-targets

macOS users must also codesign gdb: follow [these
instructions](http://andresabino.com/2015/04/14/codesign-gdb-on-mac-os-x-yosemite-10-10-2/). This will fix the error
`please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8)`.

### Windows Dependencies
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
* gdb, make, gcc

If you do not have already have gdb/make/gcc installed, there are two options to install them on Windows: `MinGW` and `cygwin`.

##### MinGW (recommended)
Minimal GNU for Windows ([`MinGW`]([http://mingw.org/)) is the recommended Windows option. [Install MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download) with the "MinGW Base System" package. This is the default package which contains `make`, `gcc`, and `gdb`.

It will install to somewhere like `C:\MinGW\bin\...`. For example `C:\MinGW\bin\gdb.exe`, `C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe`, etc.

Ensure this MinGW binary directory (i.e. `C:\MinGW\bin\`) is on your "Path" environment variable: Go to `Control Panel > System Properties > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path` and make sure `C:\MinGW\bin\` is added to that list. If it is not added to your "Path", you will have to run gdbgui with the path explicitly called out, such as `gdbgui -g C:\MinGW\bin\gdb.exe`.

##### Cygwin
Cygwin is a more UNIX-like compatibility layer on Windows, and `gdbgui` works with it as well.
* Install [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)
* When installing cygwin packages, add the following:
** python3
** python3-pip
** python3-devel
** gdb
** gcc-core
** gcc-g++


### Running from Source
In an activated Virtual Environment, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui
cd gdbgui
pip install -e .
python -m gdbgui
```

A Virtual Environment sandboxes python packages, which guarantees there will be no installation conflicts.

To create and use a new virtualenv:

```bash
pythom3 -m venv  # creates a virtual env named "venv"
source venv/bin/activate  # activates the virtualenv sandbox
pip install pip --upgrade  # make sure pip is at the latest version
```
