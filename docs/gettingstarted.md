Now that you have `gdbgui` installed, it's time to get started!

All you need to do is run
```
gdbgui
```

which will start gdbgui's server and open a new tab in your browser. That tab contains a fully functional frontend running `gdb`, by default.

You can see gdbgui in action at [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCOSclB97r9nd54NpXMV5A)

To see the full list of options gdbgui offers, you can view command line options by running
```
gdbgui --help
```

If you need help:
* Read documentation on the [homepage](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui/)
* Ask a question in the [gdbgui chat room](https://gitter.im/gdbgui/Lobby)
* [Ask question in an issue on github](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui/issues)
