# About

gdbgui was started in early 2017 with a goal to make the easiest to use and most accessible gdb frontend. It has been under active development ever since. It is in the top 3 results when searching for "gdb frontend" on google, and works on linux, mac, and windows.

It is open source and free.

[gdb (gnu debugger)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) allows you to see what is going on 'inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. It is widely distributed and used, but is terminal-based which does not always let you get a full picture of what the program is doing without looking up lots of commands.

**gdbgui** (gdb GUI, or Graphical User Interface, pronounced gee-dee-bee goo-ee) runs gdb in the background to build an easier-to-use interface to gdb.
