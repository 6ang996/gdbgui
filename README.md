# A browser-based frontend/gui for GDB.
Add breakpoints, view sourcecode, stack traces, registers, disassembly, and more. Easily hackable single page of es6 JavaScript and jQuery, with python managing a gdb subprocess on the backend (see [pygdbmi](https://github.com/cs01/pygdbmi)).

Made with a lightweight Python server (Flask), and JavaScript for the frontend. Simply run the server, view the page, and start debuggin'!

### Help

`gdbgui -h` displays command line options, such as changing the port or host ip. For any other questions feel free to email me or create an issue in github.

## Compatibility
Python versions: 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, pypy

Operating systems: Ubuntu 16.04

Browsers: Chrome

## Development

`gdbgui` was designed to be easily hackable and extendtable.

There are only three parts to gdb:

1. `gdbgui.js`: There is only a single JavaScript file, and that file contains the majority of the app itself. It sends AJAX requests to interact with gdb, then gets the response and updates the DOM as necessary.

1. `gdbgui.jade`: HTML file that defines the frontend (Note: Jade/Pug is a more concise form of html. Also note: jade has been renamed to [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug), but the Python pypi package still maintains the jade name.)

1. `backend.py`: The backend consists of a single Python file, which makes use of [pygdbmi](https://github.com/cs01/pygdbmi) to interact with a gdb subprocess, and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to set up url routing and responses.

To get started with development, set up a new virtual environment, then run

    git clone https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui
    cd gdbgui
    pip install -r gdbgui/requirements.txt
    python -m gdbgui.backend --debug

### Testing
`python setup.py test` runs unit tests located in `gdbgui/tests/test_app.py`. Add new tests there as necessary.

## TODO

Despite this list, gdbgui is quite usable in its current form

* ~~allow argument passing to the inferior process being debugged~~
* ~~add links back to github, etc~~
* ~~escape brackets on system <includes> so they don't disappear~~
* ~~only make gutter create/delete breakpoints, not anywhere in source file~~
* add button to widen windows
* add clear button to windows
* improve toolbar styling, change color when error occurs
* add preference ui elements (auto-refresh various windows after command is sent; show/hide windows as desired)
* make flash of color fade out when snapping to source code lines or restoring old history
* add autocompletion and documentation of all commands
* add ability to view/inspect variables
* add ability to view/inspect memory
