# A browser-based gui for GDB
The goal of this project is to reduce the learning curve of GDB to zero, including autocompletion and documentation of all commands.

Made with a lightweight Python server (Flask), and JavaScript for the frontend. Simply run the server, then view the page. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 with Chrome.
